Note from Nahum
questItems
Big stage, high platform An anvil stands, stands motionless, Only the crackling of faded boards is still audible, Fire under the platform, saving flame, Do not rot to the foundation of the pillar of hope, The time has come to light up the ignorant, And with a furious flame, in an instant, To see the whole world as real, without a shadow, The blacksmith is waiting, he is all impatient, A powerful blow will announce with a loud ringing his surroundings, And the platform will collapse, but still decided, Blacksmith on his last act of creation. Having been realized by a swift movement and becoming material, the object nevertheless took an ideological form.

Gloves blackmetal
equipment
Left-handed black iron gauntlet appears little more than a dull soot-stained plated glove at first glance, but in truth it is a powerful boon granted by Droskar to his most faithful subjects. Placing the glove on your left hand causes excruciating pain as your appendage curls into a tight fist and then slowly transforms to supernaturally hard black stone. You cannot use your left hand for anything beyond smashing it into objects or creatures (you cannot carry a shield or secondary weapon and you take a -4 on skill checks that usually require two hands). +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution.<br><br>Right-handed black iron gauntlet allows its wearer to use stone shape once per day. +2 enchantment bonus to Strenght<br>

leather armor +1
equipment
Warding. Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer of warding armor can activate it to end all active challenge, judgment, and smite abilities affecting her. This does not prevent opponents from selecting her as a target for these abilities in the future. As a swift action, the wearer can expend one of her own challenge, judgment, or smite abilities to refresh the armor’s ability to end these attacks.

Ring of Sustenance
equipment
This ring continually provides its wearer with life-sustaining nourishment. The ring also refreshes the body and mind; its wearer needs only sleep 2 hours per day to gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep. This allows a spellcaster that requires rest to prepare spells to do so after only 2 hours, but this does not allow a spellcaster to prepare spells more than once per day. The ring must be worn for a full week before it begins to work. If it is removed, the owner must wear it for another week to reattune it to himself.

Magic potion dispenser
randomStuff
This magically-augmented alchemical device distills a potion or alchemist extract into the knowledge needed to create its formula. By gently heating a potion or extract in the alembic for 1 hour, the device creates a few drops of magical liquid. If consumed by an alchemist, this liquid gives him knowledge of the potion’s or extract’s formula, as if it were an extract he recorded in his formula book. This knowledge lasts for 24 hours. He may scribe this formula in his formula book in the normal fashion.
