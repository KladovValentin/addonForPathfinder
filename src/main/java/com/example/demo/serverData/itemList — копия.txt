Note from Nahum
questItems
Big stage, high platform An anvil stands, stands motionless, Only the crackling of faded boards is still audible, Fire under the platform, saving flame, Do not rot to the foundation of the pillar of hope, The time has come to light up the ignorant, And with a furious flame, in an instant, To see the whole world as real, without a shadow, The blacksmith is waiting, he is all impatient, A powerful blow will announce with a loud ringing his surroundings, And the platform will collapse, but still decided, Blacksmith on his last act of creation. Having been realized by a swift movement and becoming material, the object nevertheless took an ideological form.

Glove left blackmetal
equipment
This left-handed black iron gauntlet appears little more than a dull soot-stained plated glove at first glance, but in truth it is a powerful boon granted by Droskar to his most faithful subjects. Placing the glove on your left hand causes excruciating pain as your appendage curls into a tight fist and then slowly transforms to supernaturally hard black stone. You cannot use your left hand for anything beyond smashing it into objects or creatures (you cannot carry a shield or secondary weapon and you take a â€“4 on skill checks that usually require two hands). +2 enhancement bonus to&nbsp; Constituent.
