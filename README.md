# addonForPathfinder
 a webpage and server for D&D rpg games items and other info management. It is just a normal JavaScript-programmed webpage with backend server running on java with the usage of Spring framework. It allows users to connect to the server if they are in a local network with a host (via radmin vpn for example) and dynamically change and update data on the server.

To run it:
1) Make shure that you have Java 18 on your computer and graddle
2) Download all this repository
3) Build the server project (for example, in IntelliJ IDEA)
4) Change serverAddress at \src\main\resources\static\ to yours
5) run server project
6) connect via \src\main\resources\static\index.html or http://x.x.x.x:8080/index.html

Of course there will be problems, because I haven't tested how it works on different PC :)
